For company point of view we have created a simple and effective panel to operate the website and control comments and 
news contributed by users. Company can give permission to access certain limits to users and employees. We can assign 
groups and permission to employees. For certain users increasing hate/vulgarity on platform we can trace it's IP address

# (VI) Conclusions :

We were able to produce results which are consistent with the methodology proposed. Mainy the
focus was to integrate the machine learning algorithms with our website for the completion of this
project. This provides a powerful tool in the hands of a layman to observe predicted stocks and
invest accordingly. A user friendly terminal which shows when to invest and when to divest gives a
sense of trust to these predicted values. It is important to note that the results produced are likely to
be the trend in the next 20 days. That explains that in between this time period there might be days
which are not in resonance with the result but the end result is surely accurate to predict the trend.
