efficient solution for easy investment in the stock market so that a layman can also benefit without
having prior knowledge of technicalities that a stock market carries. The Website is named as
InvestSmart and it helps people invest smartlyFirstly, the number of various examples belonging to each class were identified and plotted.

The website of Technological Stock Market Prediction has on its front page options to go to
services, know about the service, read testimonials, go to the home page, contact or stocks.

As a prototype, the Stock Market Prediction page is ready as of now. With datasets from companies
like Amazon, Google & Data Global, the website accurately predicts the stock of these companies
using the LSTM method.

On clicking upon a company, In this case an american semiconductor manufacturing company
AMD, the user is directed to a page displaying Company information, current stock values and
predictions using the LSTM model. The progress includes embedding graphs to the website with
better accuracy. The website also predicts the best time to invest and divest in a short interval of
days.

The below two pictures show the real stock price and predicted stock price for google along with the
best invest & divest periods. It also gives you an example showing how much money you will get if
you invest a certain amount in a certain stock.

# (V) Website Panel for company:



# (VI) Conclusions :

We were able to produce results which are consistent with the methodology proposed. Mainy the
focus was to integrate the machine learning algorithms with our website for the completion of this
project. This provides a powerful tool in the hands of a layman to observe predicted stocks and
invest accordingly. A user friendly terminal which shows when to invest and when to divest gives a
sense of trust to these predicted values. It is important to note that the results produced are likely to
be the trend in the next 20 days. That explains that in between this time period there might be days
which are not in resonance with the result but the end result is surely accurate to predict the trend.
